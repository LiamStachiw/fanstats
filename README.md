# FanStats

This is an web application designed to help users with their fantasy sports leagues. Currently, it only has support for NHL stats.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to act as a sandbox for myself to learn more about and practice my skills with Node.js and web development.

### This is a work in progress and is not entirely functional in its current state
